1
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,790
{\i1}Who do you think
they are to each other?

2
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,210
{\i1}Hm...

3
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,250
{\i1}I don't know.

4
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,210
{\i1}Yeah, this is a hard one.

5
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
{\i1}I think

6
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,850
{\i1}the white guy and the Asian girl
are a couple,

7
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,020
{\i1}and the Asian guy
is her brother.

8
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,310
{\i1}Or the Asian girl

9
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,390
{\i1}and the Asian guy are a couple,

10
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,320
{\i1}and the white guy
is their American friend.

11
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,400
{\i1}They're not even talking
to the white guy.

12
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,950
{\i1}Maybe they are tourists,

13
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,080
{\i1}and the white guy is
their tour guide.

14
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,490
{\i1}Drinking at 4:00 a.m.?

15
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,750
{\i1}Yeah, you're right,
that makes no sense.

16
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,580
{\i1}Hm. Maybe they're
all just colleagues?

17
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,210
{\i1}I have no idea.

18
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,070
Na Young.

19
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,620
Why are you crying?

20
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,080
Are you crying because you got
second-best marks in the exams?

21
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,260
Are you mad at me
because I got first place?

22
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,350
Yes.

23
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,030
Hey! I'm always
second place to you,

24
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,360
but I never cry.

25
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,200
If I beat you
for the first time ever and you cry,

26
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,030
how do you think
that makes me feel?

27
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,080
You psycho.

28
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,490
Don't come in!

29
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,530
Talk from over there.

30
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,240
We decided.

31
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,950
What did you decide?

32
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,210
My name will be Michelle,
and Si Young's will be Mary.

33
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,580
I thought Si Young said
that she wants to be Michelle.

34
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,470
Why would you take
your sister's name?

35
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,470
I don't have
an English name I like.

36
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,090
Na Young,
you still shouldn't take Si Young's name.

37
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,930
But I hate all the names.

38
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,600
Let's think more about it.

39
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,770
How's Leonore?

40
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,980
For short, Nora.

41
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,190
Nora.

42
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,690
Nora Moon.

43
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,450
Na Young.

44
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,120
Hm?

45
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,620
Who do you
like at school nowadays?

46
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,470
What do you want to draw?

47
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,050
Ah, I'm thinking two things.

48
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,050
I want you to draw a tree.

49
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,680
Tree?
That's what I'm good at.

50
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,850
A tree doesn't have feelers.

51
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,850
Hae Sung.

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Why?

53
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,110
He's manly.

54
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:22,820
He's manly?

55
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,200
Hm. Yeah. I will
probably marry him.

56
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,660
Really?

57
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,120
Does he want to marry you, too?

58
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,790
He likes me,
so he will if I tell him to.

59
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,330
Do you want to go
on a date with him?

60
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,770
They look so good together.

61
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,440
Hae Sung talks
about Na Young a lot.

62
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,330
Na Young told me
that she likes him.

63
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,540
We're immigrating soon.

64
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,880
So I wanted to make
good memories for her.

65
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,840
You're immigrating?

66
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,640
Yes.

67
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,900
But why are you immigrating?

68
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,320
Na Young's dad
is a film director,

69
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,030
and you're an artist.

70
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,740
Why would you leave
all that behind?

71
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,460
If you leave something behind,
you gain something, too.

72
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,410
It all looks
the same to me.

73
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,320
- Black barks and white...
- What is it?

74
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,030
This is called "blue".

75
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,000
This is called "yellow".

76
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,780
You're really leaving?

77
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,860
Yeah.

78
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,360
You're never coming back?

79
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,530
No.

80
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,950
Why are you leaving?

81
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,240
Because I want to.

82
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,950
Why do you want to leave?

83
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,910
Because Koreans don't win
the Nobel Prize for Literature.

84
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,190
Bye!

85
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,400
Na Young, take care!

86
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,520
Bye.

87
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,620
Hey.

88
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,290
What?

89
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,710
Bye.

90
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,110
- Hello.
- Hello.

91
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,480
{\i1}My name is Nora,
what's your name?

92
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,360
My name is Michelle.

93
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,160
How are you, Michelle?

94
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,620
I'm fine, and you?

95
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm fine, and you?

96
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,240
I'm fine, and you?

97
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,250
I'm fine, and you?

98
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,540
I'm fine, and you?

99
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,920
I'm fine, and you?

100
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm fine, and you?

101
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,710
- I'm fine, and you?
- I'm fine, and you?

102
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,630
I'm...

103
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,630
{\an8}{\i1}Toronto Pearson
International Airport...

104
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,900
{\an8}{\i1}Toronto Pearson International
Airport...

105
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,030
{\an8}Na Young, Si Young!

106
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,060
{\an8}Let's go.

107
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,610
{\an8}Hurry up!

108
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,610
This is from Korea.

109
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,540
This is our passport, and...

110
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,690
Whoa!

111
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,700
I mean, there is
so much in it that... that I responded to.

112
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,170
But the one phrase that sticks
with me most...

113
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,870
- Mm-hmm.
- "The long journey of rotting."

114
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,420
I liked it, too.

115
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,340
We liked how you
used the long pauses.

116
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:23,510
Woah, Dong Yun...

117
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,840
He's a lawyer now.

118
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,050
{\i1}He was a really good kid.

119
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,140
He helped me cover up
when I peed my pants in class.

120
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,060
{\i1}You'd pee
your pants all the time.

121
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,900
A bedwetter lives
in New York City.

122
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,020
{\i1}Yeah.

123
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,940
{\i1}This bedwetter is killing it.

124
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,820
Who else should we look up?

125
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,040
- What's his name?
- Hmm?

126
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,620
The boy
I had a massive crush on?

127
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,540
I went on a date with him.

128
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,330
Hmm...

129
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,580
{\i1}- Uh... Jung Hae Sung.
- Hae Sung.

130
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,440
Whoa! Mom, this is crazy.

131
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:28,110
He posted on Dad's movie's
Facebook page asking for me.

132
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,700
{\i1}What are you talking about?

133
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,330
He posted a few months ago.

134
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,080
"I am looking for Na Young...

135
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:34,830
I am her childhood friend.

136
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,000
I want to get in touch
with her."

137
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,460
{\i1}Wow. Really?

138
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,210
Let me call you back
in a minute.

139
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,750
{\i1}Okay.

140
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Um...

141
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,320
Oh, shit.

142
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,380
Hae Sung! This is Na Young.

143
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,760
{\i1}Do you remember me?

144
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:38,930
Listen...

145
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,520
This is a good thing...

146
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,560
It's a good thing!

147
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,320
Think of it as
a blessing that you broke up,

148
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,780
and consider this
a new beginning.

149
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,530
There are a lot of women in the world.

150
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,950
Don't worry!

151
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
Shit, I must be an idiot...

152
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,330
Why do I miss that bitch?

153
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,800
Of course you miss her,
you moron!

154
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,640
If you don't miss her

155
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,890
after being with her
for two years,

156
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,430
are you even human?

157
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,730
Hey, no problem. Cry hard.

158
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,020
Hey.

159
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,770
This is a good thing...

160
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,860
a good thing!

161
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,690
She didn't deserve you.
This is a good thing.

162
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,780
Hey!

163
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,490
Do you have a secret
girlfriend or something?

164
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,700
What are you
talking about?

165
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,000
Who's messaging you
at 3:00 a.m.?

166
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,340
I have no idea.

167
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:41,890
Huh?

168
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,820
Hae Sung, wake up!

169
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,430
Thank you for this meal.

170
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,780
Did you drink a lot last night?

171
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,490
Hmm.

172
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,030
Kind of.

173
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,750
Why are you in such a good mood?

174
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,990
{\i1}Woah.

175
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,030
Woah.

176
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,040
{\i1}Woah.

177
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,330
{\i1}It's you.

178
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,330
Woah.

179
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,210
{\i1}I recognize you.

180
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,130
You, too.

181
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,050
{\i1}I didn't even know
that you remembered me.

182
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,640
{\i1}I just looked for you
as a joke...

183
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,850
{\i1}then I saw that
you'd been looking for me.

184
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,980
It wasn't a joke for me.

185
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,980
I tried really hard to find you.

186
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,900
It looks like you changed
your name?

187
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,230
{\i1}Yeah. It's Nora now.

188
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,570
That's why I couldn't find you.

189
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,000
Can I just call you Na Young?

190
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,240
{\i1}Of course.

191
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,040
{\i1}But nowadays my mom
doesn't even call me Na Young.

192
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,080
Oh.

193
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,540
{\i1}It looked like
you're in New York.

194
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,130
Yeah, I'm...

195
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,010
a writer here.

196
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,170
A playwright.

197
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,050
{\i1}Hmm.

198
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,100
{\i1}Kinda like your father.

199
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:50,510
Yeah.

200
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,810
{\i1}Hey, that's cool.

201
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,770
Hmm, oh...

202
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:57,770
Hello?

203
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,310
{\i1}Hello?

204
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,190
{\i1}Can you hear me? I'm here.

205
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,780
Hmm.

206
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,860
Are you home?

207
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,700
{\i1}Yeah. I have to go
to class later.

208
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,040
My mom says
your school is a good one.

209
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,750
{\i1}It's not bad.

210
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,540
I guess you got good grades.

211
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,920
{\i1}I was ordinary.

212
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,430
We used to compete
a lot in school.

213
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,310
You cried because
you lost to me.

214
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,980
I lost once.

215
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:36,100
Do you still cry a lot?

216
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,900
{\i1}No.

217
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,860
Really?

218
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,690
You used to cry a lot
back in those days.

219
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,440
{\i1}Almost every day.

220
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,280
{\i1}You would stay with me
whenever I was crying.

221
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,200
Hmm.

222
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,370
Why don't you cry now?

223
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,450
You can't cry in New York City?

224
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,710
{\i1}Hmm...

225
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:02,790
{\i1}When I first immigrated,

226
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,470
{\i1}I used to cry a lot,

227
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,180
{\i1}but then I realized
that nobody cared.

228
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,810
I see.

229
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:19,640
{\i1}What do you study at school?

230
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,280
Uh... Engineering.

231
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,650
{\i1}I know nothing about that.

232
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,660
I like this.

233
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:41,420
{\i1}What?

234
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,590
Just...

235
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,260
{\i1}talking to you.

236
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,760
{\i1}Yeah?

237
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,560
{\i1}I'm a really fun person
to talk to.

238
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,230
Oh, yeah?

239
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:03,230
Yeah.

240
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,020
{\i1}Hmm.

241
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,950
{\i1}I gotta go to class.

242
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,070
Me, too. I have to eat dinner.

243
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,540
{\i1}You haven't eaten dinner yet?

244
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Not yet.

245
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
{\i1}Hmm... What time is it there?

246
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,130
Hmm. Midnight.

247
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,710
{\i1}And you still haven't eaten?

248
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,170
No.

249
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,880
Go and eat right now.

250
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,890
{\i1}I will.

251
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,230
What?

252
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,610
{\i1}It doesn't make sense but...

253
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,570
{\i1}I'm not sure if I can say
something like this.

254
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,990
What do you want to say?

255
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,670
{\i1}I missed you.

256
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,060
{\i1}Me too.

257
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:27,150
- Hmm.
- It doesn't make any sense.

258
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,870
{\i1}Umm, I really have to go now.

259
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,360
{\i1}Class is starting soon.

260
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,410
Okay. Bye.

261
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,040
Let's talk again.

262
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,790
{\i1}We should talk again.

263
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,370
- {\i1}I'll send you an email.
- Hmm.

264
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,630
- {\i1}Bye.
- Bye.

265
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,250
{\i1}Hey.

266
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,210
Hey.

267
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,750
Is it 7:00 in the morning there?

268
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,670
{\i1}I thought you said you never
wake up before 10:00.

269
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,850
You said this is the only time
that works for you.

270
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:48,060
Don't you have class today?

271
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,310
{\i1}Yeah.

272
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,650
{\i1}So I left home early.

273
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,780
{\i1}How was rehearsal today?

274
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,910
{\i1}Your Korean is rusty.

275
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:03,960
Hey!

276
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,200
I only speak Korean with you
and my mom.

277
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,620
You said you're leaving Korea
to win the Nobel Prize.

278
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,630
You still want that?

279
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,550
{\i1}Hmm...

280
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,720
Nowadays,

281
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,100
{\i1}I'm really interested
in the Pulitzer.

282
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:32,810
{\i1}You're the same as
the 12-year-old kid I remember.

283
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,690
Greedy?

284
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,530
{\i1}Wants to do everything,
wants to have everything.

285
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,200
Has a terrible temper.

286
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,910
{\i1}Exactly.

287
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,420
{\i1}No, no, I'm kidding.

288
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,170
So you're writing there
the whole month?

289
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,800
{\i1}Yeah.

290
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,260
{\i1}It's an artist residency.

291
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,590
{\i1}Can you see?

292
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,510
{\i1}That's cool.

293
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,220
{\i1}Where's Montauk?

294
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,940
Hmm... From New York

295
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,900
about four hours east?

296
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,900
Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind.

297
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,530
Have you seen it?

298
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:22,740
What did I do?

299
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,620
{\i1}I love you so much.

300
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,200
{\i1}I'll do anything to make
you happy.

301
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,160
{\i1}Tell me what you want me
to do and I'll do it.

302
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:35,380
Would you
ever come to New York?

303
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:39,170
{\i1}Why would I go to New York?

304
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,880
Why are you going to China?

305
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,090
{\i1}To learn Mandarin.

306
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:47,640
You should come to New York

307
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,680
{\i1}to learn English.

308
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,650
I always wanted
to learn Mandarin.

309
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,940
It's also helpful for my work.

310
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
That's good.

311
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:05,780
{\i1}That's all I know.

312
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,160
Hello?

313
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,500
Hello?

314
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,130
Hae Sung?

315
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,750
Na Young?

316
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:21,960
Can you hear me?

317
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,340
Hae Sung?

318
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,100
Can you hear me?

319
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,570
We're here.

320
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,660
You can see all of Seoul
from up here.

321
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,330
{\i1}It's beautiful.

322
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,630
{\i1}Wish I were there.

323
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,380
We should come here together.

324
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,100
I miss you.

325
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,020
Hello?

326
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,170
{\i1}Would you
ever come to Seoul?

327
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,220
Why would I go to Seoul?

328
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,530
Have you done your homework?

329
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,820
I haven't.

330
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,530
You have to do it
for graduation.

331
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:05,820
I got under academic probation
last semester.

332
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,990
- Mm-hmm.
- Class captain's message.

333
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,490
Let me see your homework.

334
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,250
Maybe next time.

335
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,960
- I'm going.
- Oh. Huh?

336
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,080
Bye.

337
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,040
What's your plan for the weekend?

338
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:22,380
Playing games.

339
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,090
{\i1}Hi.

340
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,430
Hi.

341
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,930
{\i1}You're not asleep yet?

342
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,560
Not yet.

343
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,030
You okay?

344
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,150
{\i1}Of course.

345
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,740
What did you want to talk about?

346
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,290
When is it possible for you
to come visit me in New York?

347
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,670
{\i1}A year and a half or so,

348
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,470
{\i1}because of my language
exchange program and...

349
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,300
You don't have
to explain yourself.

350
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:21,980
It'll be at least a year
before I can come visit you in Seoul.

351
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,150
{\i1}I want us to stop talking
for a while.

352
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:37,580
Why?

353
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,000
I immigrated twice to be here
in New York.

354
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,380
I want to accomplish
something here.

355
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,850
I want to commit
to my life here,

356
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,850
but I'm sitting around looking
up flights to Seoul instead.

357
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,770
So you want
to stop talking to me?

358
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,020
{\i1}Just for now.

359
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,820
It took me 12 years
to find my friend.

360
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:18,700
{\i1}I'll be back before you know it.

361
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,500
{\i1}We're just taking a brief break.

362
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,470
I think it's a good idea.

363
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,680
Why am I like this?

364
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,650
{\i1}I'm sorry.

365
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,700
What are you sorry about?

366
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,030
Were we dating or something?

367
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,720
Okay.

368
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,800
Bye.

369
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,220
{\i1}Talk to you later.

370
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,770
Okay.

371
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,190
Talk then.

372
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,470
Are you okay?
We walked around a lot.

373
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,430
My leg's a bit hurt,
but I'm okay.

374
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,600
- This leg hurt?
- It's okay.

375
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,730
- Rock, paper, scissor.
- No, thanks.

376
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,180
Hae Sung, you're late.

377
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,550
We're here because of you.

378
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,880
You all packed?

379
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,050
Almost.

380
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,100
So when are you flying out?

381
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,140
This Sunday.

382
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,810
So you'll be there all summer?

383
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,070
Hey, tonight we drink
'til we die.

384
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,940
Why is he like this?

385
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,910
Hell yeah!

386
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,990
If Hae Sung says we drink,
we drink.

387
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,410
Another soju, please!

388
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,840
Hi.

389
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,510
Hi! I'm Nora.

390
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,350
I'm Arthur. Nice to meet you.

391
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,890
When'd you get in?

392
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,230
This morning.

393
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,610
- You got the worst room.
- Right?

394
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,440
I know.

395
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,040
{\i1}There is a word in Korean.

396
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:32,970
In-Yun.

397
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:37,930
{\i1}It means "providence".

398
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,390
{\i1}Or... "fate".

399
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,690
{\i1}But it's specifically

400
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:47,190
{\i1}about relationships
between people.

401
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,570
{\i1}I think it comes from Buddhism

402
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:57,530
{\i1}and reincarnation.

403
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,820
{\i1}It's an In-Yun

404
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,870
{\i1}if two strangers even walk by
each other in the street

405
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,750
{\i1}and their clothes
accidentally brush.

406
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:09,830
{\i1}Because

407
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,630
{\i1}it means there must have been
something between them

408
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,460
{\i1}in their past lives.

409
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,890
{\i1}If two people get married,

410
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:29,730
{\i1}they say it's because there
have been 8,000 layers

411
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:30,980
{\i1}of In-Yun.

412
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,490
{\i1}over 8,000 lifetimes.

413
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,040
You believe in that?

414
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
Believe what?

415
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,840
That...

416
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:03,090
you and I knew each other
in another life.

417
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,600
What, because we are
sitting here...

418
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,070
...at the same table

419
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,530
in the same city

420
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,320
- in the same time?
- Mm-hmm.

421
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:17,230
Yeah, wouldn't that make this

422
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,570
an In-Yun?

423
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,530
Mm...

424
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:24,620
- Mm-mm.
- Mm.

425
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,380
That's just
something Koreans say

426
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,910
to seduce someone.

427
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:00,820
- Hi.
- Hi.

428
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:03,150
Where you going?

429
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:04,910
New York City.

430
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,370
Why're you going there?

431
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,700
We live there.

432
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,830
What's your occupation?

433
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,000
Writers.

434
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,160
You're what?

435
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,710
We're writers.

436
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,630
How long
were you visiting Toronto?

437
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,960
Ten days.

438
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:21,800
What was the purpose
of your visit?

439
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,380
We were visiting her family.

440
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,300
Are you two related?

441
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:30,640
We're married.

442
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,070
Thanks!

443
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,390
Hey.

444
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,180
{\i1}"If you bought
a ticket to see this show,

445
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:09,260
{\i1}"took the subway or a cab
to be here,

446
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:12,520
"it cost you something
to be here,

447
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,900
"and spend a couple hours
with these old women,

448
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,520
"that makes you
some kind of immigrant.

449
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,360
"And all this cost me
something, too.

450
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,370
"I crossed the Pacific Ocean
to be here.

451
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,620
"Some crossings
cost more than others.

452
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:37,710
"Some crossings you pay for
with your whole life."

453
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,800
...sit most of the day,

454
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,220
and in the end I...

455
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,300
And then I started
to write about...

456
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,840
{\i1}After Dinner.

457
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:51,050
Um, yeah, I mean,
it's my kind of time.

458
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,930
Uh, but you're studying, right?

459
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,190
I'm hungry.

460
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,570
Me, too.

461
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,110
What do you want to eat?

462
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:08,360
I don't know.

463
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:14,620
Ah...
What can I do?

464
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,390
- You know what I want?
- What?

465
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:35,930
Chicken wings.

466
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,230
Holy shit.

467
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,020
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

468
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,030
Oh, genius.

469
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,520
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes.

470
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,400
Chicken wings!

471
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:49,780
Mm...

472
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,830
What're you thinking about?

473
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,040
Remember I told you
about Hae Sung?

474
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,210
Oh, yeah.

475
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,960
Is that this week?

476
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:08,630
Yeah.

477
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,380
Why is he coming here again?

478
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:13,550
I think vacation.

479
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,850
Why are you going
to New York?

480
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,600
Vacation.

481
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,440
Rest, enjoy, have fun.

482
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:28,480
You're not going there
to see that girl, right?

483
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:29,940
Who?

484
00:48:31,490 --> 00:48:33,990
Why are you pretending
not to know who I'm talking about?

485
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:36,120
Your first love.
I thought she lives there.

486
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,580
You gonna see her now that
you broke up with your girlfriend?

487
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,540
You think I'm nuts?
She's married.

488
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:44,210
Really?

489
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,500
Hmm.

490
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:49,090
I think it's been
about seven years.

491
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,970
She married early.

492
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:56,890
Ah,
you poor bastard.

493
00:48:58,850 --> 00:48:59,890
What?

494
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:05,730
It's going to rain
the whole time you're there.

495
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,110
Look. "Severe thunderstorm".

496
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,240
Hey, don't forget
your rain boots and raincoat.

497
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,280
It really does say
"severe thunderstorm."

498
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,430
Uh, trunk? Trunk?

499
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,110
Hae Sung!

500
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,770
Woah. It's you.

501
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,440
Ah, what can I do?

502
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,750
What should I say?

503
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,050
I don't know.

504
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:27,430
Was the last time we talked
twelve years ago?

505
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:49,160
Glad the weather is nice today.

506
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,160
You're right.

507
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,510
Should we go?

508
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:09,220
Yes.

509
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,520
Before I got married,

510
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,850
I went to Korea with my husband.

511
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,440
I know.

512
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,530
I emailed you,

513
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,990
but you didn't respond.

514
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:57,330
I wanted to see you.

515
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:02,000
I was disappointed.

516
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:09,300
I'm sorry.

517
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:15,720
I wanted
to meet your girlfriend, too.

518
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,220
How are you two doing?

519
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,770
We're not together
right now.

520
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,320
You broke up?

521
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:31,240
No.

522
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,200
It's not that.

523
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,240
We just need time to think.

524
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,460
We just started talking
about getting married.

525
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:50,800
Do you not want
to get married?

526
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,510
I don't know.

527
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,760
If you love her,
why don't you know?

528
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,600
It's a little complicated.

529
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,140
What's complicated?

530
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,600
The conditions are not met.

531
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,270
What do you mean?

532
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,490
I'm an only child.

533
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,450
If you're going to marry
an only son,

534
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:15,280
he should make more money
and be better.

535
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,950
I'm too ordinary.

536
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,030
You're ordinary?

537
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:23,660
My job is ordinary,
my income is ordinary.

538
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:26,120
It's all ordinary.

539
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,750
She should meet someone
more impressive than me.

540
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,180
Is it hard to get married
if you don't make a ton of money?

541
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,600
At first we didn't think so,

542
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,480
but then
we started thinking that way.

543
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,280
Want me to take a photo of you?

544
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,070
Okay.

545
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,590
You look good.

546
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,730
Would you and your husband
come out here often on dates?

547
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,480
Hmm.

548
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:35,030
We lived near here before
we moved to the East Village.

549
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,650
We did all our dating here.

550
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:41,160
We would fight here, too.

551
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:44,790
- You two fight?
- Oh yeah, we don't fuck around.

552
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,290
Why do you fight?

553
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:48,660
Just because.

554
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:54,000
It's like planting two trees
in one pot.

555
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:57,670
Our roots
need to find their place.

556
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,220
Does your husband
get along with your family?

557
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:10,770
Yeah. He plays Hwa-Too
with them all the time.

558
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,560
He plays Hwa-Too?

559
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:13,940
Of course.

560
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,070
He knows how?

561
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,940
He's good.

562
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,900
Is his Korean good, too?

563
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:22,410
No.

564
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,620
But he can say a few things.

565
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,120
Oh, yeah?

566
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,910
His favorite food
is Yook-Gae-Jang.

567
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:34,340
{\i1}Yook-Gae-Jung?
He's not fucking around.

568
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,590
He's not fucking around.

569
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,380
Do you and your girlfriend...

570
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,930
fight?

571
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:46,260
No.

572
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,980
She's not really
my girlfriend right now.

573
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,520
You should get married well.

574
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,230
You're worrying about me?

575
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:05,700
Getting married is hard for
idealistic people like you.

576
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:10,370
Hey, I'm not so old
that you should worry.

577
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,910
Hae Sung.

578
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,830
Hmm?

579
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,540
Why did you look for me?

580
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:01,090
- 12 years ago?
- Hmm.

581
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,260
Do you really want to know?

582
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,560
I just wanted to see you
one more time.

583
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:18,810
I don't know.

584
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:26,280
Because you just left
so suddenly...

585
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,410
I was a little pissed off.

586
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,370
Sorry.

587
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:33,410
What are you sorry about?

588
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,290
You're right. There's nothing
to be sorry about.

589
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:43,510
You disappeared from my life,
and I just bam...

590
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,800
found you again.

591
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:49,340
Why would you do that?

592
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:54,270
I don't know.

593
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,020
Just because...

594
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,900
You kept entering my mind
when I was in the military.

595
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:08,910
I see.

596
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:24,670
We were babies then.

597
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,300
Right.

598
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,470
And when we met 12 years ago,

599
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:33,510
we were babies then, too.

600
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,560
We're not babies anymore.

601
01:04:20,350 --> 01:04:22,150
- Hi.
- Hi, my love.

602
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,860
How was it?

603
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:33,120
You were right.

604
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:36,490
I was?

605
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:38,910
Yeah.

606
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,330
He came here to see me.

607
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:32,050
It's so crazy to see him
be this grown-up man

608
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:36,350
with a normal job
and a normal life.

609
01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:38,600
He's so Korean.

610
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,400
He still lives with his parents,

611
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,230
which is really Korean.

612
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:45,900
And he has all these
really Korean views

613
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:47,360
about everything.

614
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,440
And I feel so not Korean
when I'm with him.

615
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,360
But also,

616
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,160
in some way, more Korean?

617
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,120
It's so weird.

618
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,250
I mean, I have Korean friends,

619
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:07,260
but he's not, like,
Korean-American.

620
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:09,630
He's Korean-Korean.

621
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,760
Is he attractive?

622
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:16,590
I think so.

623
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,810
He's really masculine
in this way

624
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:21,600
that I think is so Korean.

625
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:27,190
Are you attracted to him?

626
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,150
I don't think so.

627
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:34,870
I don't know, I mean...

628
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:36,360
I don't think so.

629
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,170
He was just this kid in my head

630
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:47,830
for such a long time,

631
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:52,130
and then he was just this
image on my laptop,

632
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:55,840
and now he's a physical person.

633
01:06:56,170 --> 01:06:57,220
It's really intense,

634
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,390
but I don't think
that that's attraction.

635
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,390
I think I just missed him a lot.

636
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,720
I think I missed Seoul.

637
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:07,270
Did he miss you?

638
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,690
I think he missed
the 12-year-old crybaby

639
01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:13,610
he knew a long time ago.

640
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:16,110
You were a crybaby?

641
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,780
Yeah.

642
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:21,240
Most of the time he'd have to
just stand there and watch me.

643
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:33,710
When is he leaving again?

644
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:35,470
Morning after tomorrow.

645
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:36,590
Mm-hmm.

646
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:04,370
Are you mad?

647
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,080
No.

648
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:08,380
It feels like you are.

649
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:11,290
I don't have
a right to be mad.

650
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:13,630
What do you mean?
Of course, you do.

651
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:14,720
No...

652
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,510
That guy flew
13 hours to be here.

653
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:17,590
I'm not gonna tell you

654
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,260
that you can't see him
or something.

655
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:21,510
He's your childhood sweetheart.

656
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,970
And it's not like you're gonna
run away with him.

657
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:29,850
Are you?

658
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:34,650
Definitely. I'm gonna
throw away my life here...

659
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,360
...and run away with him to Seoul.

660
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,900
Do you even know me?

661
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:44,740
I'm not gonna miss
my rehearsals for some dude.

662
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:47,790
I know.

663
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,000
I know you.

664
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:43,680
What?

665
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:49,060
I was just thinking about
what a good story this is.

666
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:53,940
- The story of Hae Sung and me?
- Yeah.

667
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:57,980
I just can't compete.

668
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:03,190
What do you mean?

669
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,330
Childhood sweethearts
who reconnect 20 years later

670
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:12,660
only to realize they were
meant for each other.

671
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,210
- We're not meant for each other.
- I know.

672
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:20,090
I know. In the story,
I would be the evil white American husband

673
01:10:20,290 --> 01:10:22,460
standing in the way of destiny.

674
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:27,720
Shut up.

675
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,760
What do you not like about it?
Our story's just so boring.

676
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:34,980
We met at an artists' residency.

677
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:39,440
Slept together because we both
happened to be single.

678
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,780
We realized
we both live in New York,

679
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:43,990
so, we moved in together
to save money on rent.

680
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:47,790
We got married so you could
get a green card. So...

681
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:49,870
Oh, you make it sound
so romantic.

682
01:10:50,070 --> 01:10:51,240
Right, that's what I'm saying.

683
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:56,090
I'm the guy
you leave in the story

684
01:10:56,290 --> 01:10:58,960
when your ex-lover
comes to take you away.

685
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,790
He's not my ex-lover.

686
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:08,430
What if you met somebody else

687
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,140
at that residency?

688
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,770
What if there was
another writer from New York

689
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,480
who had also read
all the same books you had,

690
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,560
and watched all the same movies,

691
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,020
who could give you
useful notes on your plays,

692
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:26,820
and listen to you complain
about your rehearsals?

693
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,410
- That's not how life works.
- Oh.

694
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:32,030
Yeah.

695
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:35,410
But wouldn't you be
laying here with him?

696
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,630
This is my life,
and I'm living it with you.

697
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:44,670
Are you happy with it?

698
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,850
Is this what you
imagined for yourself

699
01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:50,180
when you left Seoul?

700
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,800
When I was a 12-year-old?

701
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:54,390
Yeah. Is this what
you pictured for yourself?

702
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:57,770
Lying in bed in some

703
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,150
tiny apartment
in the East Village

704
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,570
with some Jewish guy
who writes books?

705
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:06,070
Is that what your parents
wanted for you?

706
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,910
You're asking me if you,
Arthur Zaturansky,

707
01:12:11,110 --> 01:12:13,660
are the answer to
my family's immigrant dream?

708
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:16,790
- Yeah.
- Wow.

709
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:18,410
I know.

710
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,670
This is where we ended up.

711
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,840
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

712
01:12:36,180 --> 01:12:37,180
Okay.

713
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,480
What?

714
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:48,690
It's just that you make
my life so much bigger.

715
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:52,410
And I'm wondering if I do
the same thing for you.

716
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,200
You do.

717
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,760
I'm just a girl from Korea,
you know?

718
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:20,020
And you're forgetting the part
where I love you.

719
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,600
I don't forget that.

720
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,560
I have trouble
believing it sometimes.

721
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:51,800
Do you know
you only speak in Korean

722
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:53,840
when you talk in your sleep?

723
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:56,390
- I do?
- Yeah.

724
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:01,850
You never sleep talk in English.

725
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:04,520
You only dream in Korean.

726
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,450
I didn't know that.

727
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:11,740
Yeah.

728
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:13,240
You never told me that.

729
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,570
Well, sometimes
I think it's cute.

730
01:14:17,490 --> 01:14:19,370
Sometimes, I don't know,

731
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:22,500
I guess I get scared.

732
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,290
Scared of what?

733
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:34,220
You dream in a language
that I can't understand.

734
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:39,470
It's like
there's this whole place

735
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,310
inside of you where I can't go.

736
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:54,360
I think that's why I've
been trying to learn Korean,

737
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:57,610
even though I know
it's annoying for you.

738
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:01,250
You want to understand me
when I'm dreaming?

739
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:02,580
Yeah.

740
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,750
I'm sure I'm just
saying gibberish.

741
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,910
- Hey.
- Hey.

742
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,330
Did you get home
safe last night?

743
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:46,580
Yeah.

744
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,130
Sorry I'm late.

745
01:15:49,710 --> 01:15:50,960
Did you eat something?

746
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:52,590
No.

747
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:01,010
Eat this.

748
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,890
Is it for me?

749
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,360
I wanted to ask you yesterday...

750
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:20,950
What prize do you
want to win nowadays?

751
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:22,280
Hmm?

752
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:27,000
When you were little,
you wanted to win the Nobel Prize,

753
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,710
and 12 years ago you
wanted to win the Pulitzer.

754
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,250
What do you want to win now?

755
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,890
I haven't thought
of things like that recently.

756
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:39,090
Really?

757
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:40,800
Then think about it
for a moment.

758
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:43,510
There must be an award you want.

759
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,650
A Tony.

760
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,820
You really are exactly
the same as I remember you.

761
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:59,110
Still psycho?

762
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:02,360
Still psycho.

763
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:51,450
A little bit to your left.

764
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:53,870
One, two... three!

765
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:55,710
One more.

766
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,550
Why are you taking it
so close up?

767
01:18:03,420 --> 01:18:04,390
Fine. Go back a little bit.

768
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:26,820
She's turned against us.

769
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:00,980
Hold on.

770
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:07,280
You look young.

771
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:10,160
Because of my green card,

772
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,620
we got married
a little earlier than planned.

773
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:21,590
He knows I'm coming over?

774
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Of course.

775
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,310
He knows who I am?

776
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,140
Of course!

777
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,810
He wants to meet you.

778
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:06,090
Come in.

779
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:35,160
Um...

780
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:36,910
Hello.

781
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,790
Nice to meet you.

782
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:48,970
Uh, hi.
Nice to meet you, also.

783
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,350
His Korean is good.

784
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:53,640
No.

785
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:01,480
Uh...

786
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,900
Are you hungry?

787
01:21:03,850 --> 01:21:04,940
Are you hungry?

788
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,690
- Hmm?
- Oh...

789
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:08,440
Hungry?

790
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:10,990
Ah, oh. Yes.

791
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,360
What would you like to eat?

792
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:14,910
Uh...

793
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,620
Pasta?

794
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,210
Pasta? Yeah.

795
01:21:20,410 --> 01:21:21,420
You like pasta?

796
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:22,750
Yes.

797
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:25,090
- Okay.
- Okay.

798
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,630
- Let's get pasta.
- Pasta.

799
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:34,840
What did you two do today?

800
01:21:35,470 --> 01:21:36,470
Uh...

801
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,310
The Statue of Liberty.

802
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:43,480
You took the ferry.

803
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,900
- Yes.
- Yeah.

804
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,770
It's, um, nice.

805
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,450
I've never been.

806
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:49,700
- What?
- Really?

807
01:21:49,900 --> 01:21:52,280
Yeah, I've never
actually been there.

808
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,160
Hey,
you should take your husband.

809
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:59,870
Have we seriously
never been there together?

810
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:01,540
No.

811
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:16,720
{\i1}When I was 24 years,

812
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,350
I, uh... Um...

813
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:23,730
Oh.
Military service?

814
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:25,360
Yes.

815
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:27,360
Oh, military service.

816
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:28,570
Right.

817
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,700
You know how Korean men have
mandatory military service?

818
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,320
Yeah, your dad talks about it.
How was it?

819
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:34,450
You like it?

820
01:22:34,650 --> 01:22:36,490
How was it?
Did you like it?

821
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:39,540
No.

822
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:44,500
Uh, but military and work, same.

823
01:22:45,290 --> 01:22:46,250
Same?

824
01:22:46,450 --> 01:22:47,840
Same? How?

825
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:49,710
Uh,
you have, um...

826
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,590
You have a boss.

827
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:53,720
Hmm.

828
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,260
There's overtime pay,

829
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,260
stuff like that here, right?

830
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:00,310
In Korea, you work
overtime all the time,

831
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:01,970
but there's no overtime pay.

832
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:05,310
There's no
overtime pay in Korea.

833
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:06,810
- Really?
- Mm.

834
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:09,940
You have to do
all of your boss's work first,

835
01:23:10,610 --> 01:23:12,980
then you do your own work,

836
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,700
and then you can go home.

837
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:17,910
Late at night?

838
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:19,540
That's so hard.

839
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:24,250
It's, uh, very hard.

840
01:23:24,830 --> 01:23:28,460
Hmm. Uh, work. Work is hard.

841
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,510
Hard physically or mentally?

842
01:23:31,710 --> 01:23:34,430
Physically, or mentally?

843
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:36,680
Uh, yes. Uh, both.

844
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,840
Physical, very hard.

845
01:23:40,510 --> 01:23:44,010
- Uh, and, um...
- Hmm. Mentally.

846
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,440
Uh, mentally, I'm strong.

847
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,270
Mm!

848
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:52,940
You're strong mentally?

849
01:23:53,140 --> 01:23:54,570
Yes, right.

850
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,330
It was good that you immigrated.

851
01:24:11,670 --> 01:24:14,380
Mm. I agree.

852
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:16,420
Korea is too small
of a country for you.

853
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:20,180
It's not enough
to satisfy your ambition.

854
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,720
I'm glad to have seen you.

855
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,060
Yeah.

856
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:32,440
And thank you for introducing
me to your husband.

857
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:35,730
I can tell he really loves you.

858
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:39,400
Hmm.

859
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:45,120
I didn't know that liking your
husband would hurt this much.

860
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,000
Yeah?

861
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,340
Hmm.

862
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:06,810
When we stopped talking,

863
01:25:07,010 --> 01:25:09,270
I really missed you.

864
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,860
Did you miss me?

865
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:13,980
Of course.

866
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,530
But you met your husband then.

867
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:18,360
You got a girlfriend then, too.

868
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,450
Sorry.

869
01:25:29,910 --> 01:25:30,910
It's okay.

870
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,120
Seeing you again

871
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:35,550
and being here

872
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:37,670
makes me
have a lot of weird thoughts.

873
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:40,340
What kind of thoughts?

874
01:25:42,340 --> 01:25:47,560
What if I'd come
to New York 12 years ago?

875
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:51,230
What if you had
never left Seoul?

876
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,690
If you hadn't just left
like that,

877
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:56,360
and we just grew up together,

878
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:00,030
would I still have
looked for you?

879
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:05,320
Would we have dated? Broken up?

880
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:07,120
Gotten married?

881
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:11,710
Would we have had kids together?

882
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,160
Thoughts like that.

883
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,090
But the truth
I learned here is,

884
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,050
you had to leave
because you're you.

885
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:34,100
And the reason I liked you
is because you're you.

886
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:41,610
And who you are
is someone who leaves.

887
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,410
The Na Young
you remember

888
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,280
doesn't exist here.

889
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,740
I know.

890
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,120
But...

891
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,750
that little girl did exist.

892
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,800
She's not sitting here
in front of you,

893
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,970
but it doesn't mean
she's not real.

894
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:10,850
20 years ago,

895
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:15,060
I left her behind with you.

896
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:19,150
I know.

897
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,900
And even though I was only 12,

898
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,110
I loved her.

899
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,870
You psycho.

900
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:45,630
I think there was something
in our past lives.

901
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:50,890
Otherwise, why would we
be here together right now?

902
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:55,400
But in this life,

903
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:57,400
we don't have the In-Yun to be

904
01:27:57,600 --> 01:27:59,270
that kind of person
to each other.

905
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,230
Because now, finally,

906
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,900
we're in the same city

907
01:28:05,940 --> 01:28:08,610
for the first time
in 20 years...

908
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:16,200
We're sitting here
with your husband.

909
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:26,840
In this life, you and Arthur
are that kind of In-Yun to each other.

910
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:30,510
You two have
the 8,000 layers of In-Yun.

911
01:28:32,510 --> 01:28:34,140
To Arthur,

912
01:28:35,140 --> 01:28:37,350
you're someone who stays.

913
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,650
He's talking about you.

914
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:50,870
Who do you think

915
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:52,370
we were to each other
in our past lives?

916
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:53,660
I don't know.

917
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,830
Maybe... an impossible affair?

918
01:28:57,030 --> 01:28:58,960
Between the queen
and the king's henchman?

919
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:03,590
Or maybe we were forced
to live together

920
01:29:03,790 --> 01:29:05,470
in a political marriage,

921
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:07,470
and we were awful to each other.

922
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:08,890
Cheat on each other a bunch.

923
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:10,550
Say hurtful things
to each other.

924
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,060
Or maybe we were just sitting
next to each other

925
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:15,270
on the same train.

926
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:16,600
Why?

927
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,690
Just because that's what
our tickets said.

928
01:29:21,230 --> 01:29:22,230
Maybe,

929
01:29:22,980 --> 01:29:26,400
we were just a bird

930
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,650
and the branch it sat on
one morning.

931
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:16,410
I'm sorry we speak alone.

932
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:19,200
Uh, we will stop.

933
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,340
It's okay.

934
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:31,210
You haven't seen each other
in a long time.

935
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:42,560
I never thought I'd be
a part of something like this.

936
01:30:44,180 --> 01:30:45,230
Hmm?

937
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:47,560
Sitting here with you.

938
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:55,110
Do you know what In-Yun?

939
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,240
Yeah. Nora told me about it
when we first met.

940
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,620
You and me.

941
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:07,840
Yeah. Yeah, you and I

942
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,750
are In-Yun too.

943
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:11,250
Right?

944
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:20,760
I'm really glad you came here.

945
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,060
It was the right thing to do.

946
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,000
Mm. I'm gonna
walk him to his Uber.

947
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:52,840
Okay.

948
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:58,260
Uh, nice to meet you.

949
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:01,180
Nice to meet you, too.

950
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:03,680
Uh, come visit me in Korea.

951
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,060
Definitely.

952
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:15,240
I'll be right back.

953
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,400
Okay.

954
01:33:43,780 --> 01:33:45,070
Will it be here soon?

955
01:33:45,660 --> 01:33:46,740
Hmm.

956
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,330
Two minutes.

957
01:35:22,920 --> 01:35:23,920
Hey!

958
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,010
Na Young.

959
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:34,720
Hmm?

960
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:47,570
What if this is a past life
as well,

961
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,070
and we are already

962
01:35:51,660 --> 01:35:54,700
something else to each other
in our next life?

963
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,000
Who do you think we are then?

964
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,090
I don't know.

965
01:36:12,890 --> 01:36:13,890
Me neither.

966
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,900
See you then.

967
01:37:56,910 --> 01:37:57,910
I'm sorry!

968
01:41:05,390 --> 01:41:10,230
{\i1}Building statues
In the park

969
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:17,190
{\i1}Mosaic faces
Fading in the rain

970
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:22,410
{\i1}Recalling memories of love

971
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:29,290
{\i1}We're untouched
And unscathed

972
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:38,430
{\i1}Is this really
A mystery life?

973
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:45,260
{\i1}We all learn from
Our own mistakes

974
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:51,230
{\i1}We stare, fall down stairs

975
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:56,820
{\i1}Maybe you're
Too much for me

976
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:02,950
{\i1}We cry out

977
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:07,490
{\i1}Break my heart, now

978
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:15,090
{\i1}You called it out
You called it out

979
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:17,880
{\i1}To stay here

980
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:26,140
{\i1}A long car drive

981
01:42:27,220 --> 01:42:32,650
{\i1}Music in my head

982
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:38,770
{\i1}Come from a place

983
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:45,200
{\i1}I don't know where

984
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:53,330
{\i1}Swear that stars
Are aligning but

985
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:59,470
{\i1}On a faraway stair
On a torched midnight

986
01:42:59,670 --> 01:43:05,760
{\i1}A field of death
On those marble steps

987
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:10,470
{\i1}We'll meet again in life

988
01:43:11,470 --> 01:43:13,730
{\i1}That's how it's done

989
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:16,560
{\i1}That's how it's done

990
01:43:17,480 --> 01:43:21,730
{\i1}And I would soon burn

991
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:29,530
{\i1}That's how it starts
That's how it starts

992
01:43:29,950 --> 01:43:34,160
{\i1}And I will soon know

993
01:43:35,790 --> 01:43:40,380
{\i1}Fall, fall

994
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:47,380
{\i1}Falling down
In spite of it all

995
01:43:48,220 --> 01:43:52,890
{\i1}Fall, fall

996
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:58,310
{\i1}Will we meet
Again and again?

997
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:04,610
{\i1}Ooh

998
01:44:05,490 --> 01:44:10,740
{\i1}Ooh
